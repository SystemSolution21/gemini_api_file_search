This document details the board game "Ticket to Ride," a cross-country train adventure designed for 2-5 players aged 8 and above, with a playing time of 30-60 minutes (p. 2). The game's narrative context involves five friends who, inspired by Phileas Fogg's circumnavigation, initiate an annual expedition and wager (p. 1). At the dawn of the century, they propose a new challenge: a $1 million competition to see who can travel by rail to the most cities in North America within 7 days, starting immediately (p. 1, 2).

Players compete to connect different cities by claiming railway routes on a North American map. The objective is to score the highest number of points, achieved by claiming routes between adjacent cities, completing continuous paths between cities listed on Destination Tickets, and having the longest continuous path of routes (p. 2, 3, 5). Points are lost if Destination Tickets are not successfully completed (p. 3).

The game components include a board map, 240 colored train cars, 144 illustrated cards (including Train Car cards, Destination Ticket cards, and promotional cards), 5 wooden scoring markers, a rules booklet, and an online access number (p. 2, 3). Setup involves placing the board, each player taking a set of train cars and a matching scoring marker, dealing starting hands of Train Car cards, turning five Train Car cards face-up, and dealing Destination Ticket cards (p. 2, 5). Players keep Destination Tickets secret until the game ends (p. 5).

During a player's turn, they must perform one of three actions: drawing two Train Car cards (either face-up or blind from the deck), claiming a railway route by playing a set of matching Train Car cards, or drawing three Destination Ticket cards and keeping at least one (p. 3, 4). In 2 or 3 player games, only one of the double-routes between cities can be used (p. 4).
